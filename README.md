[DIIC 2018/2019] T1 - GreenKeeper. 

The development of Green Keeper arises from the desire to change the way people interact with their houseplants. By regulating
the temperature and moisture of specific species chosen by the users, we aim to create an automated system that can relieve the
burden to fit plant care in their busy schedule.
